    options: [
      "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery",
      "Anterior resection with primary anastomosis",
      "Hartmann's procedure",
      "Defunctioning loop colostomy",
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    explanation: "For a Duke's B (T3/T4, N0) sigmoid adenocarcinoma without distant metastases, the standard treatment is anterior resection with primary anastomosis. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not standard for colon cancer (unlike rectal cancer). Hartmann's procedure is typically reserved for emergency presentations. A defunctioning colostomy alone would not address the primary tumour.",

      "Diverticular disease",
      "Colorectal carcinoma",
      "Volvulus",
      "Hernia",
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Colorectal carcinoma is the most common cause of large bowel obstruction in adults in the UK, accounting for approximately 60% of cases. The left colon and sigmoid are the most common sites. Diverticular disease and volvulus are less common causes.",

    question: "In the management of perianal Crohn's disease, which imaging modality is considered the gold standard for assessing perianal fistulae?",
    options: [
      "CT scan of the pelvis",
      "Endoanal ultrasound",
      "MRI pelvis",
      "Fistulography",
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 2,
    explanation: "MRI pelvis is considered the gold standard for imaging perianal fistulae in Crohn's disease. It provides excellent soft tissue contrast and can identify the fistula tract course, secondary extensions, and abscesses. It has a sensitivity of >90% for detecting fistulae and is superior to CT and fistulography.",

    question: "A patient undergoes a low anterior resection with defunctioning loop ileostomy. At 3 months post-operatively, they present with high-output stoma (>2L/day). What is the first-line pharmacological management?",
    options: [
      "Octreotide",
      "Loperamide",
      "Codeine phosphate",
      "Omeprazole",
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Loperamide is the first-line pharmacological agent for managing high-output stoma. It works by slowing intestinal transit and increasing water absorption. It should be taken 30 minutes before meals. Codeine phosphate is second-line. Omeprazole can be useful if there is evidence of gastric hypersecretion. Octreotide is reserved for refractory cases.",

      "3 years",
      "5 years",
      "No surveillance needed — return to screening",
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    explanation: "According to BSG guidelines, patients with 3-4 small adenomas (all <10mm) are classified as intermediate risk and should have surveillance colonoscopy at 3 years. Low risk (1-2 small adenomas) patients can return to screening. High risk (≥5 adenomas, or ≥3 with at least one ≥10mm) should have surveillance at 1 year.",
