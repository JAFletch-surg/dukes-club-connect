    options: [
      "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery",
      "Anterior resection with primary anastomosis",
      "Hartmann's procedure",
      "Defunctioning loop colostomy",
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    explanation: "For a Duke's B (T3/T4, N0) sigmoid adenocarcinoma without distant metastases, the standard treatment is anterior resection with primary anastomosis. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not standard for colon cancer (unlike rectal cancer). Hartmann's procedure is typically reserved for emergency presentations. A defunctioning colostomy alone would not address the primary tumour.",

      "Colorectal carcinoma",
      "Volvulus",
      "Hernia",
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Colorectal carcinoma is the most common cause of large bowel obstruction in adults in the UK, accounting for approximately 60% of cases. The left colon and sigmoid are the most common sites. Diverticular disease and volvulus are less common causes.",

    options: [
      "CT scan of the pelvis",
      "Endoanal ultrasound",
      "MRI pelvis",
      "Fistulography",
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 2,
    explanation: "MRI pelvis is considered the gold standard for imaging perianal fistulae in Crohn's disease. It provides excellent soft tissue contrast and can identify the fistula tract course, secondary extensions, and abscesses. It has a sensitivity of >90% for detecting fistulae and is superior to CT and fistulography.",

      "Loperamide",
      "Codeine phosphate",
      "Omeprazole",
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Loperamide is the first-line pharmacological agent for managing high-output stoma. It works by slowing intestinal transit and increasing water absorption. It should be taken 30 minutes before meals. Codeine phosphate is second-line. Omeprazole can be useful if there is evidence of gastric hypersecretion. Octreotide is reserved for refractory cases.",

      "3 years",
      "5 years",
      "No surveillance needed — return to screening",
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    explanation: "According to BSG guidelines, patients with 3-4 small adenomas (all <10mm) are classified as intermediate risk and should have surveillance colonoscopy at 3 years. Low risk (1-2 small adenomas) patients can return to screening. High risk (≥5 adenomas, or ≥3 with at least one ≥10mm) should have surveillance at 1 year.",

      "Pudendal nerve",
      "Sciatic nerve",
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 0,
    explanation: "The obturator nerve runs along the lateral pelvic sidewall and is most at risk during lateral pelvic lymph node dissection. Injury can cause weakness of hip adduction. The pudendal nerve is at risk during perineal dissection. The femoral and sciatic nerves are not typically encountered in pelvic surgery.",

      "Subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis",
      "Hartmann's procedure",
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    explanation: "In the emergency setting, subtotal/total colectomy with end ileostomy is the preferred approach. This avoids pelvic dissection in an acutely unwell patient and preserves options for future restorative surgery. Proctocolectomy with IPAA should not be performed as an emergency due to the risk of pelvic sepsis and pouch failure.",

      "Dukes' C1",
      "Dukes' C2",
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 0,
    explanation: "T2 N0 M0 corresponds to Dukes' A, where the tumour invades the muscularis propria but does not extend through it, with no lymph node involvement. Dukes' B involves extension through the bowel wall (T3/T4 N0). Dukes' C involves lymph node metastases.",

    question: "A 45-year-old patient presents with a low rectal tumour 4cm from the anal verge. MRI shows T3 N1 disease with threatened circumferential resection margin. What is the recommended neoadjuvant treatment?",
    options: [
      "Short-course radiotherapy (25 Gy in 5 fractions)",
      "Long-course chemoradiotherapy",
      "Chemotherapy alone",
      "Proceed directly to surgery",
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Long-course chemoradiotherapy is recommended for locally advanced rectal cancer with threatened CRM. This allows tumour downsizing and downstaging, increasing the chance of achieving a clear resection margin. Short-course radiotherapy is more appropriate for resectable tumours without threatened margins.",

      "Hundreds of colorectal polyps by age 30",
      "Associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma",
    ],
    correctAnswerIndex: 3,
    explanation: "FAP is associated with desmoid tumours, duodenal adenomas, osteomas, and epidermoid cysts (Gardner syndrome), but NOT medullary thyroid carcinoma. Medullary thyroid carcinoma is associated with MEN2 syndrome. FAP is caused by mutations in the APC gene on chromosome 5q21 and follows autosomal dominant inheritance.",
